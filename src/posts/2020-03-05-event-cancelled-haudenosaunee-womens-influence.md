## !This Event was cancelled due to concerns over COVID-19!

Due to concerns about the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have made the difficult decision to cancel our March 9th event, The Haudenosaunee Women's Influence on the Women's Movement with Gloria Steinem.
The Matilda Joslyn Gage Center is processing refunds via Eventbrite.
If you have questions please contact Melissa Almeyda, matildajgagefoundation@gmail.com or 315.637.9511.

Thank you for your continued friendship and support of our work.
