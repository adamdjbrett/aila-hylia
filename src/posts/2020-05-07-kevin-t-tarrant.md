In memory of our friend and colleague Kevin Tarrant. Please give as you are able to support his family and his legacy. We are thankful these wonderful words from Safe Harbors NYC:


It is with great sorrow and with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our Co-founder and Managing Director of Safe Harbors NYC, on May 4, 2020, Kevin Thomas Tarrant, Little Lightening & Yellow Bear (Hopi/Ho-Chunk) part of the Sky Clan and Bear Clan.

Husband, Father, Brother, Nephew, and friend of many, our hearts are broken. As we carry his song forward, his footprints are ones that will be followed by many generations to come. The warmth Kevin gave radiated from his smile and he welcomed all with an embrace that would feel like “home”. For in him, we saw “home”, a place where a shared vision of inclusiveness existed. Never losing his optimism, he shined on and encouraged us to forge ahead with love and dedication.

Among Kevin’s many accomplishments, he was the Lead singer of SilverCloud Singers (New York City), Former Executive Director of the American Indian Community House, Panel-speaker, teacher, presenter, performer, and composer of numerous events, shows, and honoring ceremonies, to name a few. Creating a safe haven for community members to gather and compose their own songs and stories, his focus was always that of bringing the community together, wanting a harmonious song to be spoken between all. Kevin’s contributions are endless and he will not be forgotten.


We will be honoring Kevin this Thursday May 7th, 2020 6-8pm (SHARP)

Viewing will be at:
Thiele-Reid Funeral Home
585 Belgrove Drive Kearny, NJ 07032
