Hylia (pronounced /ˈhaɪliə/ HY-lee-ə)also known as The Goddess, and later Zelda, is a goddess featured in Skyward Sword. She is depicted throughout the world by both statues and imagery, often as having had angelic wings and holding a sword in her right hand. Beginning as a divine entity, she was later, by her own choice, reborn into a mortal form as the first incarnation of Zelda, making her the true ancestor to the Royal Family of Hyrule and explaining the magical powers passed down within their bloodline. Hylia is eternally reborn.
